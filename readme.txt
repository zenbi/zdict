zdict
-----

zdict is a gtk dictionary viewer for the edict database.

"English to Japanese" and "Japanese to English" (romanji) are the only options.

because zdict is GPL, and the database is compiled and linked into the program, 
the database that it uses must also be GPL.


edict
-----

this program uses the GPL version (pre 2000-03-25) of Jim Breen's edict 
japanese-english dictionary.

you may not link a non-GPL version of edict into zdict.

more information about edict can be found in:

	edict.txt
	edict_r.txt
	edict_license.txt

and the edict homepage at http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/j_edict.html

note: the EDICT.DOC file (refered to in the edict license) was renamed 
to edict.txt to comply with file naming standards.
