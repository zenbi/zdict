
EDICT_R
-------

The EDICT_R file consists of the 
entries from the  V97-002 edition of 
the EDICT file. These entries have had 
all fields containing kanji removed, 
and all the readings have been 
converted to Hepburn romaji. Note that 
the romaji is in fact "wa-puro-" 
romaji, i.e. it differs slightly from 
the usual Hepburn form as follows: 

- long vowels in gairaigo are 
  represented with a "-". 

- long vowels in Japanese words are 
  written with the usual Japanese 
  vowel, which is usually a "u", and 
  sometimes "o" or "i". Thus Tokyo 
  appears as Toukyou, Kyoto as Kyouto, 
  Osaka as Oosaka, etc. (Normal 
  Hepburn either doubles the vowel, or 
  uses a macron over the vowel.) 

- the voiced "tsu" syllable is written 
  "dzu", not "zu". Similarly the 
  voiced "chi" is written "dji". This 
  is to distinguish them from the 
  voiced "su" and "shi" syllables, 
  which are written as "zu" and "ji". 

Other romanized files may be made
available later.
